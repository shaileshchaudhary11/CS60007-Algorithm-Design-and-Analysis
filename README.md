Convex-Hull

A convex hull algorithm is a method for constructing a convex hull, which is a geometric object that encloses a set of points on a two-dimensional plane. The vertices of a convex hull maximize the area while minimizing the circumference.

In this assignment, we have provided svg files we need to find the minimum convex hull to cover all this points.
